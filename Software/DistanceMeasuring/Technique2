Using encoder to calculate how many pulses we make to reach the distance
for each rev. the encoder count 40 pulse.
and for each rev. the distance the car take is calculated by its circumference 2*pi*radius 
so to reach a distance we get it as how many pulses we need to take 

PulsesNeeded = Length *( 40/(2*pi*radius))
