this tutriol shows building a line follower RC car with an QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array.
Connections : 

1) DC Motors connect to the H bridge
2) The QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Connections

- The Sensor VCC connect to the Arduino +5V
- The Sensor GND connect to the Arduino Ground
- The Sensor pin 2 connect to the Arduino Analog 0
- The Sensor pin 3 connect to the Arduino Analog 1
- The Sensor pin 4 connect to the Arduino Analog 2
- The Sensor pin 5 connect to the Arduino Analog 3
- The Sensor pin 6 connect to the Arduino Analog 4

- Download the library;
  https://github.com/pololu/qtr-sensors...
- Rename the folder “qtr-sensors-arduino-xxxx” to “QTRSensors”
- Drag the “QTRSensors” folder into the “libraries” directory inside your Arduino sketchbook directory

4) After installing the library, restart the Arduino IDE
