it has many ways to make it.
it depends on the ir sensor which tells it's black or white
Source of a project uses 3 ir sensor to do it : https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/16336/line-follower-robot-using-arduino-5f5698

found that for more accuracy of driving we should use PID Algorithm. 
with this algorithm we consider the error of getting off the track and feedback the speed of motors to get the car back to the track
