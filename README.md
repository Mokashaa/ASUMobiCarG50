# ASUMobiCarG50

We’re a group of students aiming to learn more and transform our knowledge to actual practical work. 

This project is simply a Remote controlled Car, it’s implemented using Arduino micro-controller.
Firstly, our main focus is to implement the car; starting with it’s design, the coding of the Arduino, the application through which we can control it. 
The car will have more functions including:
Avoiding obstacles, line following, a set of sensors,.. etc.

Detailed description of the car will be added in the wiki when we finish each phase of the implementation.
